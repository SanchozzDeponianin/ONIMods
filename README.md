Limited support for so-called beta versions:

# Local Downloads
Steam users: Before trying a local download or reporting an issue, use [PeterHan's Mod Updater](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2018291283)  to see if the mod is out of date.

Steam sometimes serves outdated mod versions, and Oxygen Not Included is also available on the Epic Games Store. Local copies of these mods are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/SanchozzDeponianin/ONIMods/releases) section. These mods should be installed into the `Local` folder, creating it if it does not already exist. Mods should remain in their own subfolder.

+ Mac OS: `/Users/user name/Library/Application Support/unity.Klei.Oxygen Not Included/mods/Local` Replace user name with your user name.
+ Linux: `~/.config/unity3d/Klei/Oxygen Not Included/mods/Local`

Note, the `Local` folder name is case-sensitive on Mac OS and Linux.
