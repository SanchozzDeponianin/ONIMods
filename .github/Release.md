For users of the WeGame or Epic Game Store versions, or if Steam does not update mods (but first try [Peter Han's Mod Updater](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2018291283)), local versions are available.  
Extract the desired mod from the ZIP file and place it in the Local mod folder as shown in the [readme](https://github.com/SanchozzDeponianin/ONIMods#local-downloads).
